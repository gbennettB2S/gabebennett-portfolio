# Gabe Bennett - Portfolio Website

Hi, my name is Gabe Bennett, designer and UI developer. 
This is the codebase for my personal portfolio website, 
[gabebennett.com](https://gabebennett.com).

This is a fully responsive, custom designed React frontend with a headless 
Wordpress backend. It's built and developed using Vite and packages are 
managed with NPM.

The primary frontend tech is React, React Router, MUI, SCSS, 
UIkit (for the Slideshow component).

I use the Wordpress Pods Framework on my server to construct custom post 
types that provide the specific portfolio content 
(JSON) needed through the Wordpress API endpoints.

### Install and Run

To run locally, execute the following commands after pulling:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
